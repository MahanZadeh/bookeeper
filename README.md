# Bookkeeper

A class-based Python module for book management.

## Description

The module converts an excel file of books with certain attributes (e.g., author, publisher, shelf number, etc.) into book objects that can then be searched by any attribute, and each books shelf number can be edited.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Python 3.9

### Executing program

Run books.py

## Help

A sample excel file containing book details is added. You can add your own excel file as long as it follows this format of 8 column: Author, Title, Publisher, Shelf, Category, and Subject. In books.py, you will need to change the .xls and .json file names in functions convert_excel_to_list(), convert_library_to_json(), open_json_file(), and check_if_json_exists() so that they match your excel and json file names.
