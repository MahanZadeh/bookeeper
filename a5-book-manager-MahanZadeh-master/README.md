perform_book_search() has indirectly been thoroughly tested in test_Library.py, as a result and in the interest of time
, I've only provided a small sample in test_perform_book_search.py.

I also found process_chosen_user_command() to be too big (calling on various functions) to unittest.

I have no idea how to unittest check_if_json_exists() and convert_excel_to_list() and convert_library_to_json().
